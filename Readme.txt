What is this?
=============

This plugin runs one or more arbitrary parameterless SQL commands on a schedule.

You can adjust the frequency the task runs by editing the timing under Site Administration > System > Scheduled tasks.

Why?
----

You might want to be able to create an update / insert command for pushing some kind of data around in the database. Or perform an arbitrary sql command on a schedule.

This plugin gives you the power to do anything the database user has permission to do.
